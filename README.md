# WBANS
##WBANS(Wireless Body Area Network) for healthcare 
###Designed a hybrid deep learning model using CNN-AE and LSTM with Self-Attention to capture temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling precise anomaly and sensor fault detection in WBANs
###Achieved a 97% accuracy in anomaly detection by optimizing hyperparameters and leveraging precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics, ensuring reliable real-time fault detection in WBANs
